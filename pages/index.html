    <ul>
      <li>Current release: none have been published yet</li>

        new features ready for next release</li>
      <li><a href="dev/">Branch <tt>dev</tt></a>: upcoming features
        that still need more work before they get accepted
        into <tt>master</tt></li>
      <li><a href="experiments/">Branch <tt>experiments</tt></a>: more
        wild stuff usually far from being ready</li>
